Since the beginning of this course, we learned to train agents in a *single-agent system*  where our agent was alone in its environment: it was **not cooperating or collaborating with other agents**.

This worked great, and the single-agent system is useful for many applications.

But, as humans, **we live in a multi-agent world**. Our intelligence comes from interaction with other agents. And so, our **goal is to create agents that can interact with other humans and other agents**.

Consequently, we must study how to train deep reinforcement learning agents in a *multi-agents system* to build robust agents that can adapt, collaborate, or compete.

So today weâ€™re going to **learn the basics of the fascinating topic of multi-agents reinforcement learning (MARL)**.

And the most exciting part is that, during this unit, youâ€™re going to train your first agents in a multi-agents system: **a 2vs2 soccer team that needs to beat the opponent team**.

## Course Maintenance Notice ðŸš§

Please note that this **Deep Reinforcement Learning course is now in a low-maintenance state**. However, it **remains an excellent resource to learn both the theory and practical aspects of Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

Keep in mind the following points:

- *Unit 7 (AI vs AI)* : This feature is currently non-functional. However, you can still train your agent to play soccer and observe its performance. But the leaderboard for AI vs AI soccer was shut down.
